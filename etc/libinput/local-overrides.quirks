# Fix DWT (disable-while-typing) for ASUS Zenbook Duo + keyd.
# keyd grabs the physical keyboard and re-emits via a virtual keyboard,
# breaking libinput's DWT device pairing. The touchpad is already tagged
# internal by udev, but the keyd virtual keyboard is not — mark it internal
# so libinput pairs them for DWT.
