# SHA-256 hashes of unpatched upstream Noctalia QML files.
# Used to detect when upstream changes after a noctalia-shell-git update.
# Regenerate on fresh upstream: sudo bash patch_noctalia.sh --save-upstream-hashes
#
# To populate: reinstall noctalia-shell-git, then run --save-upstream-hashes
# BEFORE running patch_noctalia.sh (so hashes reflect unpatched files).
